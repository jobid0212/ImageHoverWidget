# ImageHoverWidget
ImageHoverWidget for pyqt5
A pyqt5 widget that creates an effect where an image will appear if someone hovers their mouse over a certain area of the window. 

Why image hover effects are useful
- Image hover effects improve user interaction by providing immediate feedback
- They can guide users toward making certain decisions, like clicking on a link or button
- They can make navigation more interesting and engaging
- I'm sure there are other niche uses

Import the ImageHoverWidget class into your desired pyqt5 project
To create an ImageHover object inside the main window
- self.image = ImageHoverWidget()

I have attached the imageTest2.py file as a working example of implementing the ImageHoverWidget class into a pyqt5 project
